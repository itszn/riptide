        <div><h2>FAQ</h2></div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>What is R.I.P.Tide?</h4>
          <p>R.I.P.Tide is a vulnerability in Webkit's Riptide garbage collector that leads to arbitrary code execution in the Safari browser</p>
          
          <h4>What is Riptide?</h4>
          <p>Riptide is a concurrent garbage collector built into the Webkit framework, and
thus in Safari and other browsers that use webkit. Riptide will collect javascript garbage (like the language itself)
and throw it out in the background while the rest of javascript runs. This has given webkit
a 5% speed boost when running your 50mb of javascript frameworks. It also allows you to
UAF any javascript object the nation state actors want, all at the same time!</p>

          <h4>Am I vulnerable?</h4>
          <p>R.I.P.Tide was fixed in Safari 11.1.1, shipped in MacOS version 10.13.5 and iOS 11.4<p>
          <p>If your macbook or iPhone is behind this version, then yes anyone can run arbitrary code from your browser</p>

	  <h4>Is this vulnerability serious?</h4>
    <p>R.I.P.Tide can be triggered simply by visiting any website with javascript enabled. <script>document.write("As you have just done so now on this site, we would recommend you update as soon as you can...<!--")</script>Luckily you do not have javascript enabled for untrusted sites. This is not a perfect protection, but you are a lot safer than all those other scrubs who actually like to enjoy the internet</--></p>
    <p>If you are still vulnerable, that means you have not updated your iPhone/macbook. Several root exploits have also been released for these versions, so it is trivial for any one to fully exploit your device as it stands.</p>

          <h4>Were there any signs of exploitation in the wild?</h4>
          <p>We googled riptide, and turns out people were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJ_1HMAGb4k">talking about this all the way back in 2013</a> no idea if this means bad actors were exploiting it at that time however.

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Why R.I.P.Tide?</h4>
          <p>Because this kills the javascript</p>
          
          <h4>How do I use this document?</h4>
          <p>This FAQ provides answers to some of the most frequently asked questions regarding the R.I.P.Tide vulnerability. You can also follow <a href="https://blog.ret2.io">blog posts about its discovery and exploitation...</a></p>

          <h4>How can I detect exploitation?</h4>
          <p>If a website downloads javascript from a server, and tries to have your browser run it, its probably malicious, and you should report it to the cyber police asap</p>

          <h4>Can my antivirus detect or block this attack?</h4>
          <p>The exploit involves taking a javascript array and reversing it. That's it. Good luck writing a signature for that doesn't falsely detect the rest of the random javascript frameworks (Although maybe the world would be a better place if they were all blocked)</p>
          
          <h4>Is this an OpenSSL bug?</h4>
          <p>No.</p>
          
          <h4>Do I need to update my browser?</h4>
          <p>Only if you are still using safari for some reason. Although you probably want to update chrome, firefox, and edge too. They are not really much better when it comes to this kind of thing.

          <h4>How many people are affected?</h4>
          <p><a href="https://caniuse.com/usage-table">According to caniuse.com</a> Safari has a combined usage of over 10% of all browsers. Adjusting for the population of earth, that is 760 MILLION people! That's a lot of javascript garbage to collect.

	  <h4>How can Webkit be fixed?</h4>
    <p>Well it <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/commit/4277697ef9384adea6f4c63ed1215a05990e85b4">already was</a>. If you maintain your own fork of webkit for what ever reason, make sure to include this commit in your next release.</p>

          <h4>How do I uninstall Apple software?</h4>
          <p>Please follow <script>document.write('<a href="' + (!navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/)?'https://youtu.be/xhnB16mMHuU?t=26s':'https://youtu.be/QR9_T00xmik?t=36s') + '">these</a>');</script> instructions.</p>
          
          <h4>Who found the R.I.P.Tide vulnerability?</h4>
          <p>The fine folks at <a href="http://ret2.io">Ret2Systems</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Is this vuln really serious enough to deserve a name, a logo and a web page?</h4>
          <p>Literally everyone has a logo and website these days, why should we deviate from the trend?</p>

          <h4>What can be done to prevent this from happening in future?</h4>
          <p>First everyone should stop using javascript. Or maybe just disable the garbage collector, so people still using javascript will suffer as their browser consumes all their ram.</p>
